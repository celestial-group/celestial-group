            A sunny morning! John, a newly graduated civil engineer
            ,wakes up at 8 in the morning in a
            small apartment located in West Pymble. He has a busy day ahead of him.
             He needs to arrive at the CBD office by 9:00. After a quick breakfast,
             he goes straight to his driverless car and starts the engine...

            <p>Before getting on the Motorway, the car needs to navigate itself
              through several residential roads. Except in the designated driverless
               car zone, the residential roads are shared by driverless cars and normal vehicles.
             It means that John's fancy new car still needs to obey the current traffic rules like
           traffic lights and stop signs. Not the most fancy way to use a driverless car,
           but as more driverless zones gradually roll out, the situation will be much better.

            <p>The car is on the motorway! Before getting on the motorway,
              John has told the smart vehicle that the maximum toll he wants
              to pay is $5. The vehicle, bears that in its "mind", decides which
              lane to use to get John to the destination as quickly as possible
              while under budget. The price of each lane is diffrent. And it is
              based on the target lane speed and current congestion level.
              The prices are broadcasted to the vehicle's navigation system.
              And the vehicle can make its own decision about lane usages.
              John has nothing to worry on the motorway except
              that picturesque view that he can enjoy while the car is driving itself
              through the harbour bridge.</p>

            <p>Finally the center of the metropolis. To maximum traffic flow,
              Sydney CBD is one of the first zones that have been designated
              as Driverless Zones. Only Driverless Vehicles are allowed.
              With the implementation of Autonomous Intersection Management System.
              The processing rate of the existing intersections have been doubled.
              The speed limit is also raised due to a reduction in the perception/reaction time of the vehicles.
              The result? Only two minutes for John to sprint from motorway exit to the office parking lot.
